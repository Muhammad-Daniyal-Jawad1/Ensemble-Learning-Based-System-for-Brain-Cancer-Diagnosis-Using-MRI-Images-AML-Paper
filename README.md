## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing
- Images resized to **224×224 pixels**
- Pixel values normalized to **[0, 1]** (divided by 255)

### 2. Image Enhancement
- **ESRGAN** (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN) used to upscale and sharpen MRI images, improving feature extraction quality for downstream models.

### 3. Models Used

#### EfficientNetB3
- CNN with compound scaling across depth, width, and resolution
- Lightweight and optimized for real-time inference
- Achieved the highest individual accuracy

#### VGG16 & VGG19
- Deep CNNs from the Visual Geometry Group
- Use 3×3 convolutional filters and 2×2 max-pooling layers
- VGG19 (19 layers) slightly outperforms VGG16 (16 layers)

#### Stacking Ensemble
- Base models trained on the original dataset
- Their predictions serve as input features to a **meta-model**
- Meta-model learns optimal combination of base predictions

## 📊 Results

| Model | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy |
|-------|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|
| EfficientNetB3 | 99.82% | 99.77% |
| VGG19 | 99.35% | 98.86% |
| VGG16 | 98.91% | 96.49% |
| **Ensemble (Stacking)** | **99.79%** | **99.39%** |

The stacking ensemble effectively mitigates individual model weaknesses, yielding robust and generalizable classification performance.

## 🔮 Future Work

- **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)**: Allow clinicians to search for similar historical MRI cases using latent feature representations (autoencoders / ViTs).
- **Clustering & Similarity Matching**: Apply k-means clustering with Euclidean distance metrics to speed up similar-case retrieval.
- **FAISS Integration**: Use approximate nearest neighbor algorithms for scalable retrieval over large medical datasets.
